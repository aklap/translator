*Translator

Description:
--
Translator is an app that allows you to upload an image, convert it to text and then convert the text into a different language. It's like a pocked translator and was inspired by the billSplit app I made.

Tools:
--
-OCRAD.js, a library for OCR using Tesseract engine
-JavaScript
-Yandex API for translation

Issues:
--
There are many libraries for OCR but they utilize only 2 engines: Tesesract or GOCR (Google OCR). Most of them are several years old and aren't updated and there's little documentation. 

Iris Classon had a tutorial that was very helpful; it is from 2014, though. 

Be aware that when calling the OCRAD function to convert images you are using the correct input types. 

Future features/to do:
--

- Add styling
- Fix file upload 
- Use Yandex API
